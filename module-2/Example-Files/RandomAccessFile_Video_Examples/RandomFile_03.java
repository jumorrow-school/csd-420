       * Instances of this class support both reading and

       *    A random access file behaves like a large array 
       *    of bytes stored in the file system. 
       *    There is a kind of cursor, or index into the implied array, 
       *    called the file pointer; 
       *    input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer 
       *    and advance the file pointer past the bytes read. 
       *    If the random access file is created in read/write mode, 
       *    then output operations are also available; 
       *    output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer 
       *    and advance the file pointer 
       *    past the bytes written. Output operations that write 
       *    past the current end of the implied 
       *    array cause the array to be extended. The file pointer 
       *    can be read by the getFilePointer 
       *     method and set by the seek method.
