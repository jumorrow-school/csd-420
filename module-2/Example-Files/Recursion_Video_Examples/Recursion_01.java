 * Recursion - Use recursive methods
 *
 * Usually enables you to write a simple solution to a more difficult problem
 *
 * In the recursion process you will use something like an if-else of switch statement
 *   to control execution
 *
 * Loops control execution by controlling loop execution
 * Recursion controls execution by method invoking
 *
 * Recursion has over head, may take longer to execute that a loop format
 *
 * Recursion process may also take more memory
 *
 * Problems solved with recursion can also be solved without recursion
 *   However this may be more difficult to write and maintain
 *
 * Lastly "Tail recursion" executes with no executing statements after a method return
 * This example is not "Tail recursion"
 *
 * Recursion may be performed with multiple methods in their invoking process
