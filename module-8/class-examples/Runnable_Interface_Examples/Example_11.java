 * Create one new thread
 *
 * Runnable interface is the primary template for any object that is intended to be executed by a thread. 
 *  It defines a single method run(), which is meant to contain the code that is executed by the thread.
 *  Any class whose instance needs to be executed by a thread should implement the Runnable interface.
 *  The Thread class itself implements Runnable with an empty implementation of run() method.
