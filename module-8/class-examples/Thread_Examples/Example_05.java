 * Starting daemon threads
 *
 * Lets main thread and all forked thread finish before daemond threads
 *
 * The main thread is a non-daemond thread
 *
 * Daemon threads are low-priority threads whose only role is to provide services to user threads.
 *
 * Since daemon threads are meant to serve user threads and are only needed while user threads are running.
 *   They will not prevent the JVM from exiting once all user threads have finished their execution.
 *   That's why infinite loops, which typically exist in daemon threads, will not cause problems, because any code, 
 *   including the finally blocks, won't be executed once all user threads have finished their execution. 
 * For this reason, daemon threads are not recommended for I/O tasks.
